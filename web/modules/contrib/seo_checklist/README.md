# SEO Checklist

The SEO Checklist module provides a list of SEO actions that will maximize the
presence of your website in the major search engines.

While this module provides little functionality on its own, it will helps you
track the necessary steps to completing the on-page, technical SEO for your
website, which is a necessary component of a good online marketing campaign.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/seo_checklist).
