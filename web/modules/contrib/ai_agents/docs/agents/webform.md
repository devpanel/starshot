# Webform Agent
The Webform Agent is capable of creating and editing Drupal [Webforms](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform), which can
be used as questionnaires, surveys or other type of forms. This does explicitly
not delete webforms.

This plugin is experimental, and provided by the [AI Agents Extra module](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_extra).

You can test the AI Agent using [the AI Agents Explorer](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_explorer).
For more information on triggering AI Agents using custom code, please see
[the developers guide](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/developers/using_ai_agent_in_custom_code.md).
