# Views Agent
The Views Agent can create Drupal Views. This means that they can be used to
setup a web view around an entity type, including pages, blocks and if plugins
exists maps, data exports like csv, json etc. This agent only needs a valid
entity type to start.

This plugin is experimental, and provided by the [AI Agents Extra module](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_extra).

You can test the AI Agent using [the AI Agents Explorer](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_explorer).
For more information on triggering AI Agents using custom code, please see
[the developers guide](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/developers/using_ai_agent_in_custom_code.md).
