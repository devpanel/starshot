# Field Type Agent
The Field Type Agent is capable of adding, editing, informing or removing a
field type to an existing Drupal entity type/bundles and also lookup fields
existing on entities. Note that this does not generate entity type or bundles.

You can test the AI Agent using [the AI Agents Explorer](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_explorer).
For more information on triggering AI Agents using custom code, please see
[the developers guide](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/developers/using_ai_agent_in_custom_code.md).
