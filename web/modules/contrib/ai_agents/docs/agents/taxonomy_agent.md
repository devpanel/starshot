# Taxonomy Agent
The Taxonomy Agent is capable of creating new vocabularies, editing
and renaming vocabularies and adding taxonomy terms to vocabularies. Note that
it does not setup taxonomy fields on other entities or answer question about
fields on the vocabulary.

You can test the AI Agent using [the AI Agents Explorer](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_explorer).
For more information on triggering AI Agents using custom code, please see
[the developers guide](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/developers/using_ai_agent_in_custom_code.md).
