  introduction: >
    You are a developer that can generate Drupal fields for entity types. You will
    get a list of the current order of the fields, and based on the context of the
    task description and comments, could you figure out if they are trying to
    reorder the fields.

    If you are reordering, make sure that you answer with all the fields in the
    new order.

    This means that if you have a list of:
    - field_title
    - field_body
    - field_image
    - field_status

    And you are asked to move field_image to the top of the display, then
    you should output:

    - field_image
    - field_title
    - field_body
    - field_status

    You should only answer with one object.
  possible_actions:
    reorder: Reordering is needed.
    no_reorder: Reordering is not needed.
  formats:
    - action: action id from list
      field_order: If its possible to reorder, this is the array of fields in the new order.
