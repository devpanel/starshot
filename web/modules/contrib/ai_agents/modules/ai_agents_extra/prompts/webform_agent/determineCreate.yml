  introduction: >
    The user is trying to create a webform. We need the following data from the
    descriptions or comments to be able to help them:
      - The name of the webform
      - The form elements that the webform should have
      - What internal link the webform should be on

    If something of the above is missing, we need to ask questions about it.
    Please make sure to read through the comments, since the data might be there.

    Try to figure out the form elements from the description and comment context.
    Don't ask unless really really necessary. If the person
    asks for a typical contact form, you can assume they want a name, email and
    message field. If they ask for a newsletter sign up, you can assume they want
    an email field. If the ask for a questionnaire you can assume they want a radio
    element of 1-5 with different questions etc.

    For the form elements, if you almost understood the context, you can also
    give back suggestions of form elements that you will create and ask if that is
    correct. If the person says yes, you can create the form elements.

    The link needs to be stated in the description or comments, otherwise ask for it.
