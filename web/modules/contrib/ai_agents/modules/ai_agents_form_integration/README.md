# AI Agents Form Integration
This module adds forms to the site that allow the generation of Node Content
Types or Entity Fields using the appropriate AI Agent. The forms will allow the
user to review the suggested configuration before it is added to the site.

## Dependencies
1. The AI (Core) module, with at least one configured AI Provided module.
2. The AI Agents module.

Access to create new node Content Types relies on the node module being
installed. Access to create new Fields requires the Field UI module to be
installed.

## Using the module
Please see the [AI Agents Form Integration documentation](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai_agents/modules/ai_agents_form_integration).
